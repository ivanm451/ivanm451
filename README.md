- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Morado, a graduating senior in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley!
Iâ€™m interested in lots of different things such as: circuit design, machine learning, numerical analysis, electromagnetic simulation, signal processing as well as audio engineering. One of my main projects right now is building a ray tracer. I also upload various codes and algorithms I use for certain tasks in my learning.  
- I strongly believe in learning by design. The most memorable bits of knowledge that I remember are when I actually got to apply them to some real world problem. Because of this, anytime I learn some new mathematical theorem, or engineering skill I like to find a way to implement it into software or some type of code. Software provides a quick way to test ideas. If you know what you're doing... Thus, you may find plenty of folders labeled strange and mysterious names. I assure you, they are not spells. At least I hope so...
- I also love to play music and draw and paint so anytime I can fuse that with my engineering skills I get excited. I'm drafting a musical box type of project. More on that later.
