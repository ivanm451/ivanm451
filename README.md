- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Morado, a graduating senior in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley!
Iâ€™m interested in lots of different things, but as of right now my main focus is in learning and mastering the optical sciences. One of my main projects is building  an open-source optical simulation suite so that for any one interested in optics they can jump right in and start learning design. My first stretch goal is to get a simple ray tracing up and running. It's a long-term project so stay tuned for future updates. 
- I believe in learning by design. The most memorable bits of knowledge that I remember are when I actually got to apply them to some real world problem. Because of this, anytime I learn some new mathematical theorem, or engineering skill I like to find a way to implement it into software or some type of code. Software provides a quick way to test ideas. If you know what you're doing... Thus, you may find plenty of folders labeled strange and mysterious names. I assure you, they are not spells. At least I hope so...
- I also love to play music and draw and paint so anytime I can fuse that with my engineering skills I get excited. I'm drafting a musical box type of project. More on that later.
