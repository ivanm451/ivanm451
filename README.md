- 👋 Hi, I’m Ivan Morado, a graduating senior in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley!
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of different things, but as of right now my main focus is in learning and mastering the optical sciences 
- and applying it towards the design of high-fidelity single photon sources, as well as building advanced imaging devices for the life sciences. 
- I am also interested in photonic crystals, crystallography and using computational methods towards finding new forms of materials.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to model a photonic crystal using MEEPs, an open-source software designed by MIT physicists. My current project
- involves mapping and measuring the optical properties of two silicon-nanopatterned membrane reflectors. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
