- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Morado, an Array Test & Characterization engineer for IBM. My background is in Electrical Engineering, but you'll find lots of different projects here not directly related to electroncs and computer architecture. On one hand you'll find some HDL, schematic, processor design stuff that I'm dabbling with. On the other side you'll find some heavier programming projects related to graphics, numerical analysis, video game development and anything else of interest. I like to think of myself as a modern day wizard, whereby the computer and the electron are my spell book and source of power...
- I strongly believe in learning by design. The most memorable bits of knowledge that I remember are when I actually got to apply them to some real world problem. Because of this, anytime I learn some new mathematical theorem, or engineering skill I like to find a way to implement it into software or some type of code, or even better, some hardware realization! Software provides a quick way to test ideas. If you know what you're doing... Thus, you may find plenty of folders labeled strange and mysterious names. I assure you, they are not spells. At least I hope so...
- I also love to play music and draw and paint so anytime I can fuse that with my engineering skills I get excited. I'm drafting a musical box type of project. More on that later.
